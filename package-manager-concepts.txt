Components of a module helping with debian packaging

Package
    - abstract definition of a packge which pertains to binary as well as source
      packages in that it has a name, an upstream version, and a debian version. 
Source Package
    - Basic attribute tracking, read/write ability for control files. 
      Allows you to modify control files or override lintian errors or 
      add a watch file, also build and extract source.
Binary Pacakge
    - Has a 'parent' Source Package object
    - basically nothing else except for possibly a pass-through method
      for writing control information.

Source Package Builder
    - builds source packages, handles extra repos, updating, etc.
    - Can be initialized from a dsc or orig tarball.


Package Manager 
    - Manages a single source package with a hidden db file in that directory,
      keeps track of state, when was the last time it was uploaded, built, etc.

Packages Manager
    - Keeps track of where all the source packages are on the system. Allows you
      to query them from wherever.
